This is a basic React component which allows you to easily place your Net Promoter Score in your
React site or app. For easiest results you can pass in the NPS score via props, along with the total reviews, you can also pass in an img url to the logo prop to display your logo beneath.

```
<NpsBadge npsScore={64} totalReviews={120} lo={url} />
```
